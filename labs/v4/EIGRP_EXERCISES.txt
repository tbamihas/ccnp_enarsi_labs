Advanced EIGRP Configuration Exercises:

Exercise 1: Classic Config
1. Configure EIGRP classic mode on R1, R3, and R5 using AS number 100.
2. Advertise the respective loopback networks and the directly connected networks on these routers within EIGRP.

Exercise 2: Named Config
1. Configure EIGRP named mode on R2 and R4 with AS number 100.
2. Ensure the same loopback and directly connected networks are advertised within EIGRP as on R1, R3, and R5.

Exercise 3: Router ID
1. Configure static Router-IDs on all routers to match their hostname. E.g - R1 should have a RID of 1.1.1.1.

Exercise 4: Passive Interface
1. On routers using named mode, configure EIGRP to be passive on all loopback interfaces using AF interface configurations.
2. On routers using classic mode, use the `passive-interface` default command and selectively activate EIGRP on interfaces connecting to other routers.

Exercise 5: Authentication
1. Set up MD5 authentication between R2 and R4 for the 40.0.0.0/30 network.
2. Set up MD5 authentication between R1 and R3 for the 20.0.0.0/30 network.

Exercise 6: Wide Metrics
1. On routers with named mode, activate wide metrics for the respective EIGRP address families.

Exercise 7: Unequal Load Balancing
1. On R1, manipulate the delay metric on the interfaces towards R2 and confiure tha correct variance value to establish unequal-cost load balancing.

Exercise 8: Timers
1. Modify EIGRP hello and hold timers on R3's interface towards R5 (172.10.0.0/30 network) to be different from the default, but still keeping the adjacency alive. Also modify the timers on R4 towards R5.

Exercise 9: Route Summarization
1. On R4, configure an EIGRP summary address for the loopback networks to be advertised to R2.

Exercise 10: Stub Features
1. Configure R5 as an EIGRP stub, ensuring it only advertises connected and summary routes.

Exercise 11: IP Bandwidth
1. On R1, adjust the bandwidth on the interfaces connecting to R2 and R3 to influence EIGRP's metric calculations.

Exercise 12: Route Manipulation
1. On R2, use an ACL and route-map to prevent R4's loopback networks (4.4.4.0/24, 5.5.5.0/24, 6.6.6.0/24) from being advertised to R1.
2. On R3, block the R5 loopback network from being received.
3. On R3, apply a route-map to stop advertising the loopback networks from R4 to R2.

Exercise 13: Traffic Steering with Offset Lists
1. Implement an offset list on R4 to increase the metric for incoming routes from R2 for the network 2.2.2.0/24.

Ensure after each exercise to validate the setup using the `show ip eigrp` commands and confirm that the network operates as expected.
