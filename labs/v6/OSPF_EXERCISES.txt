Advanced OSPF Configuration Exercises:

Exercise 1: Multi-Area OSPF Configuration - DONE
Designate OSPF Areas:

Configure R1, R2, and R3 in Area 0.
Place R3's connections to R4 and R5 in Area 1.
Assign R4's connection to R6 and R5's connection to R6 in Area 2.
Configure OSPF:

On R1, R2, and R3, enable OSPF for all interfaces and specify Area 0.
On R3, configure its interfaces toward R4 and R5 for Area 1.
On R4 and R5, configure OSPF for interfaces in both Area 1 (towards R3) and Area 2 (towards each other and R6).
On R6, enable OSPF for all interfaces in Area 2.

Exercise 2: OSPF Network Types and DR/BDR Elections - DONE
Configure Network Types:

Set the R2-R4 and R3-R5 links as point-to-point.
Configure the R1-R2, R1-R3, and R4-R6 networks as broadcast and ensure proper DR/BDR elections occur. Document the DR/BDR for each segment.

Manipulate DR Elections:
On the R3-R4 link, adjust OSPF priorities to ensure R3 becomes the DR.

Exercise 3: LSA Operation Examination
LSA Inspection:
After OSPF convergence, use show ip ospf database on routers in different areas to examine the presence and types of LSAs (Type 1, 2, 3, and so forth).
Specifically, identify Type 3 Inter-Area LSAs generated by R3 as it advertises routes from Area 0 into Area 1, and from Area 1 into Area 2.

Exercise 4: OSPF Area Types Configuration - DONE
Configure Area Types:
Make Area 2 a Totally Stubby Area and observe the LSA types present within the area. Verify that R4 generates a default route into Area 2. Observe the new IA default route get injected into R6's RIB.
Convert Area 1 into an NSSA.
Redistribute a static route on R5 into OSPF and examine the presence of Type 7 LSAs within Area 1 and how it's translated into Type 5 LSAs by R4 or R3. Then make the redistribution remain only within the NSSA.

Exercise 5: Route Summarization and Filtering
Summarization:
On the backbone ABRs configure route summarization for R1's Loopback networks being advertised from Area 0 into Area 1.

Filtering:
Implement outbound inter-area route filtering with a prefix-list on the ABRs to prevent R3's loopback network from being advertised from Area 0 into Area 1.
Implement inbound filtering on R1 using a route-map to prevent R2's loopback network from being learnt.

Exercise 6: OSPF Authentication - DONE
Configure Authentication:
Implement IPsec (AH only) authentication on the Area 0 interfaces of R1, R2, R3 and R4.
40 char hex: A5DEC4DD155A695A8B983AACEAA5A97C6AECB6D1
area 0 authentication ipsec spi 256 sha1 A5DEC4DD155A695A8B983AACEAA5A97C6AECB6D1

Implement IPsec (ESP) authentication for Area 1 on R3, R4, and R5.
64 char hex: 3402ABF6FD6A4D11BCC93D68C0848C4BB515DBF2359AF8507C884125B839595C

Exercise 7: Advanced OSPF Features
Virtual Links:
Simulate a disconnection that isolates Area 2 (R2-R4 link) from Area 0 and use a virtual link through Area 1 to reestablish connectivity.
Prereqs: remove area 1 nssa type. 

OSPF Path Manipulation:
Use cost manipulation to influence the traffic flow between R1 and R2's Loopback, ensuring that the path via R3 is preferred over the path via R2.

Validation and Troubleshooting
After each configuration step, validate OSPF operation using show and debug commands to verify neighbor relationships, OSPF route installation, and proper LSA propagation.
Document any OSPF adjacencies that fail to form or routes that do not appear as expected, then diagnose and resolve the issues.
